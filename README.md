## About

Welcome to **Cameron's Tech Journal**\! This repository hosts the source code for my open-source personal blog website, designed to hold articles that I write following my interests. Here, you will find blog posts discussing topics such as software development, cybersecurity, and general technology.

-----

## Features

This blog site is built to inform visitors about topics that I find intriguing:

  * **Blog Pages:** This site will be composed of blog pages, all accessible from a universal home page.
  ### Future skills to be added
  * **Simple Light & Dark Mode Toggle:** For users who prefer a darker or lighter site.
  * **Blog Page Tagging System:** A tagging system to group similar blog posts together based on similarity, allowing for more easy site traversal.
  * **Interactive Comments section:** A section for users to communicate their opinions and respond to one another.
  * **Log-in with Google / Discord (User Accounts):** The ability for users to access their previous comments and respond to comment replies.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio site is crafted using the foundational pillars of web development:

  * **Next.js (React Framework):** Used for static site generation (SSG)
  * **HTML & JavaScript:** HTML provides the structure and semantics, while JavaScript powers the interactivity.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** Employed for styling and design. It's a utility-first CSS framework that accelerates development by composing designs directly in the markup using pre-defined classes, ensuring a consistent and responsive visual style.
