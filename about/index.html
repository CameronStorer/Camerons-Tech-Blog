        <p alt="portrait" >Hi, I am Cameron Storer, a current sophomore studying Computer Science 
        at Louisiana Tech University. I've had a passion for programming and computers ever since I homebrewed
        my Nintendo 3DS and installed my first Minecraft mod. Today, I have an itch to crawl further and
        further down the deep hardware and software rabbit hole. I am always interested in learning new things
        and will never tire of writing programs.

<h1>How was this Created?</h1>

<p>This site is made up entirely of the languages html and css with small amounts of javascript
included. It is currently hosted for free on Github Pages. The code editor of choice used
to code this site was VS Code and Gitbash was used to commit and push updates. The languages
needed were researched with help from Google's Gemini LLM.
